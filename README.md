# Simple App Interface, with SwiftUI

This was a basic desgin for a app that i planned to launch on the Apple App Store. The concept was to make a media platform where someone can review, rate, music from artists. This would give everyone an opportunity to talk about the music they are currently listening to, also I planned to add a feature to follow a artist to get notified when they release new music. The last feature is the main concept of my app on the App Store called [Thaleia](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/thaleia/id1581369776).

I did not go through with the idea, because i did not think it was all that unique but i did make some basic placeholder UI for it, so i'm putting it on here.
